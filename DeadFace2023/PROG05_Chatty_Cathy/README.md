The provided SOLUTION.md is ripped straight from the development board for DeadFace 2023. It includes the question as provided to the player as well as well as my intended solution via an variable overflow. The trick is to notice in the get_settings() function, the last scanf() call requests data of size Long from the user, but stores it in a Short. This can be used to overflow the start_cmd variable in the custom struct to execute print_flag(). You could also reverse engineer the binary to find the address of print_flag() and manually return to it, but I stripped the binary when I compiled it to make that method non-trivial.

File PROG05.c contains the full code that was compiled into the binary provided to the players. The code in SOLUTION.c is all the players had access to.
The PROG05 binary was compiled with options -static and -s as seen in the Makefile. -static statically links it to make it more portable, and -s strips the function symbols to make reverse engineering harder.
